## üìñ Usage

Prerequisites: Docker and Compose

Configure `EMAIL_HOST_USER` and `EMAIL_HOST_USER` in _app\\django_project\\settings.py_.

You can now start the app by running:

```bash
docker-compose up -d --build

```

It should now be up and running at [http://localhost:8002](http://localhost:8002).

To actually create an event,

1. Create a super user using

   ```bash
       docker-compose exec web python manage.py createsuperuser
   ```

2. You can now log in to [http://localhost:8002/protected/](http://localhost:8002/protected/) to view and manage your events
